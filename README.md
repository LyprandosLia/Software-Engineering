Project Summary â€“ Business CRUD Application
Objective
Design and develop a small-scale business CRUD application with a three-tier architecture (front-end, business logic, relational database).
The focus is on implementing 3 to 4 core business functionalities of your choice, rather than covering every possible requirement.

Requirements for Implementation
Develop a working software prototype demonstrating key CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

Follow the Waterfall development model for project planning and execution.

Provide use case diagrams with at least two user roles and at least three use cases per role (excluding login/logout).

Deliver a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document detailing your system.

Create a User Acceptance Testing (UAT) document with at least 3 tests per implemented use case.

Prepare a demo with running code that showcases the implemented functionalities. Partial implementation is acceptable.
